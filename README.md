HW6 Concept Questions:

1. The connectivity between vertices and the adjacency of faces are the two most important pieces of information needed to set SYM pointers in a mesh with all half-edges created but no SYM pointers set. Every half-edge joins two vertices, and its square of SYM is another half-edge joining the same vertices in the opposite direction. Furthermore, each half-edge's SYM borders an adjacent face because it borders a particular face. One way to set SYM pointers efficiently is to map vertex pairs to half-edges using a data structure such as a hash map. This makes it possible to query with reversed vertex pairs to quickly identify symmetric counterparts, which expedites the process of creating SYM relationships in the mesh.

2.  The Drawable::drawMode function in the Drawable class specifies the type of primitives (e.g., triangles, lines, or points) used for drawing a mesh, defaulting to GL_TRIANGLES. This setting informs OpenGL how to interpret the buffered vertex data to construct the mesh's visual representation. The Drawable::getIndexBufferLength method returns the indexBufferLength value, indicating the total number of indices in the index buffer. This value is essential for the glDrawElements function, determining how many indices to process during rendering. It ensures OpenGL correctly renders the geometry by reading the appropriate amount of indices, translating them into the specified primitives for visual output.

HW7 Concept Questions:

1. Information includes: positions of new vertices generated from original ones, edges, and faces; connections between new and existing vertices and edges; edge pairs for maintaining mesh integrity; and the order of edges surrounding new faces for proper half-edge linking. Additionally, tracking which half-edges are incident to each vertex is crucial for updating verticesâ€™ links to their outgoing half-edges, ensuring the subdivided mesh remains well-structured and navigable for further processing or rendering.
  
2. After extruding a face and turning all edges into quadrangles via the extrusion algorithm, the crucial operation is the repositioning of the newly created vertices. This step is necessary to give the extruded feature its intended shape and volume. Specifically, vertices of the newly extruded face are moved outward or inward along the normal direction of the original face. This displacement creates the three-dimensional effect of the extrusion. A particular iteration that requires special handling involves vertices at the edges or corners of the extrusion. Here, the computation for the direction and magnitude of movement must consider the varying angles and curvatures of adjacent faces. Correctly handling this iteration is vital for maintaining the geometric integrity and aesthetic of the extruded feature, ensuring that the extrusion seamlessly integrates with the original mesh geometry, especially in cases of complex shapes or when the mesh includes non-planar surfaces.
